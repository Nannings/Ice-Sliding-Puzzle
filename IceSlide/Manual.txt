Ice Slide Puzzles
=How to Use=


PART 1
>> Ice Slide Generator <<

Description: Used to mass produce mazes based on certain requirements.


1) Open the program once and it will generate a config file for you to edit parameters.
This file is named genconfig.txt

2) Edit the parameters in genconfig.txt to your preferences and run the generator program to mass-produce mazes.

((Parameters))
gridwidth = number of columns (x axis width)
gridlines = number of rows (y axis height)

blockratio = the approximate ratio of the number of blocks to the map size.
	(e.g. a blockratio of 0.3 in a 10x10 maze means about 30 blocks)

minsteps = the minimum amount of steps required to solve the puzzle.
	(e.g. if minsteps = 25, it will only generate puzzles which require 25 steps or more to solve)

minjump = jump is a measure of the difficulty. Puzzles with higher jump tend to be more difficult.
	(it is related to how much further or nearer to the finish you will be if you take a random step)

trapallowed = 0 means mazes where you can get trapped are not allowed. 1 means it's ok.


maxloops = the number of iterations (modifications) of the maze to try to get it to suit the conditions before discarding
	(best to leave it as 100)

maxretries = the number of times the program will try again by generating a new maze.
	(best to leave it as 100000 or 10000000)

filestogenerate = For mass production. The program generates the number of mazes stated here.

filename = name the file how you want.
	(if filename = maze, then files will be named maze1.txt, maze2.txt, maze3.txt etc)







PART 2
>> Ice Slide Solver <<

Description: Solves a maze for you and prints a nodemap.


1) Open the program. It will prompt you to type a filename. Enter the name (without the .txt extension) of the maze file.

After that, these information will be presented to you:

MAP SIZE - self-explanatory (x,y)
STARTPOINT - Location of start point. top left corner is (0,0)
ENDPOINT - Location of goal. top left corner is (0,0)

SOLUTION STEPS - the minimum amount of steps required to solve the puzzle (fastest solution)
TRAPS EXIST - 1 means it's possible to get trapped in the maze, requiring a reset if it happens.
NET JUMP - a parameter describing the difficulty of the maze. explained in part 1.

Finally, a node map will be drawn.
 # signs are blocks.
 Everything else is a space.

 Each position you can reach is labelled with a number or letter. This shows the number of steps required to get to the goal from that position.
 e.g. 6 means you need 6 steps to reach the finish from there.
 0 is obviously the finish point.
 ABCDEFG etc represents 10 and above, with A=10, B=11 and so on.

 ! means a trap point. if you reach a node marked !, you cannot reach the goal any more.

 The start point is not labelled. Look at the coordinates.


Alternatively, you can read the text file yourself.
FONT: SYSTEM
0 -> block
_ -> space
+ -> start point
= -> finish








PART 3
>> Ice Slide Player <<

Description: Allows you to play the mazes


1) Enter the filename of the maze you want (without the .txt)

2) The maze will be loaded.

P = player position
X = finish point
# = block


Controls: (type the letter and press enter)
w,a,s,d = directional movement
q = quit maze (and load a new one)
r = reset

You will be praised for completing the puzzle in the minimum amount of steps.
